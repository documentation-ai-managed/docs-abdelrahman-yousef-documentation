## Creating and Editing Pages

Use the built-in editor to create and modify pages. Follow these steps to get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Page" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your documentation root. Click the `New Page` button and enter a filename like `quickstart.mdx`. The editor opens automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Content" icon="edit-3">
    Write in Markdown or MDX. Add frontmatter at the top:

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: Quickstart Guide
    description: Get started in minutes.
    ---
    ```

    Use headings starting with `##` for sections.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview and Publish" icon="eye">
    Click `Preview` to see live changes. Save with `Ctrl+S` (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>) to publish instantly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Always include YAML frontmatter in every `.mdx` file for proper metadata rendering.
</Callout>

## Organizing Content Hierarchy

Structure your docs with folders and frontmatter to create a navigable sidebar. Use `_sidebar.mdx` or directory nesting.

| Level | Method | Example Path |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Root | Index page | `index.mdx` |
| Section | Folder | `guides/quickstart.mdx` |
| Subsection | Nested folder | `api/v1/endpoints.mdx` |

For complex hierarchies, define links in `_sidebar.mdx`:

````mdx
```mdx
# Sidebar Configuration
- label: "Guides"
  href: "/guides"
  collapsed: false
  items:
    - label: "Quickstart"
      href: "/guides/quickstart"
```
````

<Expandable title="Advanced Hierarchy Tips" default-open="false">
  Avoid deep nesting beyond three levels. Use `href` for external links and `collapsed` to control expansion.
</Expandable>

## Version Control Basics

Integrate Git for tracking changes. Connect your repo via platform settings.

<CodeGroup tabs="Git Bash,CLI">
  ```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial docs commit"
  git remote add origin https://github.com/abdelrahman-yousef/docs.git
  git push -u origin main
  ```
  ```bash
  # Clone existing repo
  git clone https://github.com/abdelrahman-yousef/docs.git
  cd docs
  git pull origin main
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="info">
  Enable GitHub integration in settings to auto-sync commits with your live docs.
</Callout>
